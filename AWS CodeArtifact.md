AWS CodeArtifact is a secure, highly scalable, managed artifact repository service that helps organizations to store and share software packages for application development
- You can use CodeArtifact with popular build tools and package managers such as the NuGet CLI, Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, pip, and twine
- CodeArtifact helps reduce the need for you to manage your own artifact storage system or worry about scaling is infrastructure
- There are no limits on the number or total size of the packages that you can store in a CodeArtifact repository
- You can create a connection between your private CodeArtifact repository and an external, public repository, such as npmjs.com or Maven Central
- CodeArtifact will then fetch and store packages on demand from the public repository when they're requested by a package manager
