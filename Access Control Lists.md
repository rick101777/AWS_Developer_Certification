Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another account can access a resource
- ALCs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account
- ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does not use the [[JSON Policy Document Structure]]
- [[Amazon S3]], [[AWS WAF]], and [[Amazon VPC]] are examples of services that support ACLs
