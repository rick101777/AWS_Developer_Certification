If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs)to any or all of your accounts
- SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for [[IAM]] users and [[IAM]] roles within accounts of an organization or organizational unit
- The SCP limits permissions for principals in member accounts, including each AWS account root user
- An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides an allow in other policies
